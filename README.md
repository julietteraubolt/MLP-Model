# MLP-Model
ICS661 Assignment 1 - Multi Layer Perceptron Model

# Task To Be Done:
You are required to develop a Multilayer Perceptron (MLP) model using the training set and evaluate its
performance on the testing set. Your evaluation should include performance metrics and any other
relevant analysis (such as hyperparameter).

# Dataset Overview:
The dataset is provided in two files: train.csv and test.csv, representing the pre-partitioned training and
testing sets, respectively.

• train.csv: Contains 60,000 instances.

• test.csv: Contains 10,000 instances.

Each line in the files corresponds to a single labeled data instance.
